### Hello!

My name is Andrew and here is a quick rundown of myself:

- Currently in the latter half of my 3rd year of studies as a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo.
- Previously interned as a Software Engineer at Top Hat (x2), Tesla, and Moveworks.
- I'm looking for challenging and impactful problems to solve.
