### Welcome

My name is Andrew and here is a quick rundown of myself:

- Open to 4-month coop opportunities starting Summer 2022.
- Starting an internship as a SWE intern at Tesla starting September 2021.
- Entering my 3rd year of studies as a Software Engineering student @UWaterloo.
- Strong full stack development background, though I am open to all kinds of work.
- If you play Minecraft we can be friends.
